      I'm currently a Software Engineer at
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.jenius.com/" target="_blank">Jenius, SMBC Indonesia,</a> where I've been working on digital banking systems for the past 4 years. I graduated in Informatics / Computer Science from
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.its.ac.id/" target="_blank">ITS (Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember)</a> and along the way discovered how much I enjoy solving tough problems and building systems that people can rely on.

    <p>
      As a software engineer, I love working on the backbone of financial technology systems, ensuring they are robust, scalable, and secure. My goal is always to create software that feels solid behind the scenes while keeping things simple for the people using it.

      Outside of work, you'll probably find me exploring new tools and side projects, learning something tech-related, or just geeking out about how technology changes the way we live.
